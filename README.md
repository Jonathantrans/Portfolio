Hello world! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. It is in my best interest to introduce myself to my teachers, colleagues, and recruiters by showcasing my great accomplishments through my experiences and projects, as well as my personality! I hope you enjoy your stay.

Bugs to Update:
- Hover is light blue, need to change it to a dark gray.
- Hover button weird color needs to be removed when clicked.
- Needs a button icon for projects.
- Projects 2 and 3 are missing.
- Add Chess Game to Github.
- Change hover text color from light gray to a darker gray or burgundy.
